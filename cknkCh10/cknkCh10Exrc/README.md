Section 10.4

<!-- START: Problem Statement -->

The following program outline shows only function definitions and variable declarations.

```C
int a;

void f(int b)
{
    int c;
}

void g(void)
{
    int d;
    {
        int e;
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    int f;
}
```

For each of the following scopes, list all variable and parameter names visible in that scope:

a. The `f` function  
b. The `g` function  
c. The block in which `e` is declared  
d. The `main` function  

<!-- END: Problem Statement -->

# Solution:

<!-- START: ordered-list -->
<ol type="a">
<li>

The `f` function

- External variable `a` is visible inside the function `f`.  
- Parameter variable `b` is visible throughout the function `f` and has automatic storage duration.  
- Local variable `c` is visible inside the function `f` from the line of declaration to the end of the function `f`. And the variable has automatic storage duration.  

</li>
<li>

The `g` function

- External variable `a` is visible inside the function `g`.  
- Local variable `d` is visible inside the function `g` from the line of declaration to the end of the function `g`. And the variable has automatic storage duration. The variable is visible inside any block of the function `g` that appear after the declaration of the variable.  
- Local variable `e` is visible only to the block of function `g` in which its duration is only until the end of the block (not the function block).   

</li>
<li>

The block in which `e` is declared

*Note: The answer given for option `(b)` is applicable here too. In brief, external variable `a`, local variable `d` (declared in function `g`) and local variable `e` (declared inside the block inside of function `g`) are visible to the block.*

</li>
<li>

The `main` function

External variable `a` and the local variable `f` are visible inside the `main` function.

</li>
</ol>

Section 10.4

<!-- START: Problem Statement -->

The following program outline shows only function definitions and variable declarations.

```C
int b, c;

void f(void)
{
    int b, d;
}

void g(int a)
{
    int c;
    {
        int a, d;
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    int c, d;
}
```

For each of the following scopes, list all variable and parameter names visible in that scope. If thereâ€™s more than one variable or parameter with the same name, indicate which one is visible.

a. The `f` function  
b. The `g` function  
c. The block in which `a` and `d` are declared  
d. The `main` function  

<!-- END: Problem Statement -->

# Solution:

<!-- START: ordered-list -->
<ol type="a">
<li>

The `f` function

- The external variable `c` is visible.  
- The local variable `b` hides the external variable `b` and is visible throught the function.  
- The local variable `d` is visible inside the function.  

</li>
<li>

The `g` function

- External variable `b` is visible throughout the function `g` without conflicts.  
- External variable `c` is hidden by the local variable `c`. And the local variable `c` is visible throughout the function.  
- Parametric variable `a` is visible till the end of the function excluding the block inside the function. Because the local variable `a` declared inside the internal block of the function hides the parametric variable `a`. Visibility of the local variable `a` is limited to the internal block of the function.  
- Local variable `d` is visible only inside the internal block of the function and is not visible to the entire function. Local variable `d` declared inside the function `f` is different from the local variable `d` declared inside the internal block of the function `g`.  

</li>
<li>

The block in which `a` and `d` are declared

*Note: The answer provided in option `(b)` is applicable here also.*

</li>
<li>

The `main` function

- External variable `b` is visible in the `main` function.  
- External variable `c` is hidden by the local variable `c` of the `main` function. Local variable `c` is visible throught the `main` function.  
- Local variable `d` is visible throughout the `main` function. This variable is different from the ones in functions `f` or `g`.  

</li>
</ol>

Section 10.4

<!-- START: Problem Statement -->

Suppose that a program has only one function (`main`). How many different variables named `i` could this program contain?

<!-- END: Problem Statement -->

# Solution:

There can be any number of variables named `i` exist in the program since there can be any number of blocks in the one function.
