@@@@ Exercise 12 (Section 6.4): knkcch06e12: The following "prime-testing" loop 
appeared in Section 6.4 as an example:
	for(d=2;d<n;d++)
		if(n%d==0)
			break;
This loop isn't very efficient. It's not necessary to divide n by all numbers 
between 2 and n-1 to determine whether it's prime. In fact, we need only check 
divisors up to the square root of n. Modify the loop to take advantage of this 
fact. Hint: Don't try to compute the square root of n; instead, compare d*d with 
n.
