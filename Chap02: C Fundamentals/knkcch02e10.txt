--Exercise 10 (Section 2.8): knkcch02e10: In the dweight.c program (Section 2.4) 
which spaces are essential?
=========================================================================
SOLUTION:
--The dweight.c program is as follows.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int height, length, width, volume, weight;

  height = 8;
  length = 12;
  width = 10;
  volume = height * length * width;
  weight = (volume + 165) / 166;

  printf("Dimensions: %dx%dx%d\n", length, width, height);
  printf("Volume (cubic inches): %d\n", volume);
  printf("Dimensional weight (pounds): %d\n", weight);

  return 0;
}
--Single space at three locations in this program are essential.
--Space between int and main() is essential.
--Space between int and height at the variable declaration line is essential.
--Space between return and 0, the last statement of the program is essential.
