--Exercise 2 (Section 4.1): knkcch04e02: If i and j are positive integers, does 
(-i)/j always have the same value as -(i/j)? Justify your answer.
==========================================================================
SOLUTION:
-- (-i)/j always have the same value as -(i/j).
-- In case (-i)/j, signs of numerator and denominator are evaluvated first and
then the the integers.
-- In case -(i/j), the integers are evaluated first and then the quotient is 
multiplied by the - sign.
