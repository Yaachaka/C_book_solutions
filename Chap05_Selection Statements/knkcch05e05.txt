--Exercise 5 (Section 5.2): knkcch05e05: Is the following if statement legal?
	if(n >= 1 <= 10)
		printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
If so, what does it do when n is equal to 0?
==========================================================================
SOLUTION:
-- The given if statement is legal, But does not produce the output as intended.
-- Result of comparison of constant 10 with boolean expression is always true.
-- Check PROGRAM OUTPUT.
