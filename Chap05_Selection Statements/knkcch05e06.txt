--Exercise 6 (Section 5.2): knkcch05e06: Is the following if statement legal?
	if(n == 1-10)
		printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
If so, what does it do when n is equal to 5?
==========================================================================
SOLUTION:
-- The given if statement is legal.
-- The given if condition will be true and its block of statements will be 
executed only when n=-9.
-- When n=5, the if condition results in false and its block of statements are 
not executed.
-- Check PROGRAM OUTPUT.
