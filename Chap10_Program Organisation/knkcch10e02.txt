@@@@ Exercise 2 (Section 10.4): knkcch10e02:The following program outline shows only 
function definitions and variable declarations.

	int b, c;
	
	void f(void)
	{
		int b, d;
	}
	
	void g(int a)
	{
		int c;
		{
			int a,d;
		}
	}
	
	int main(void)
	{
		int c, d;
	}

For cach of the following scopes, list all variable and parameter names visible in that 
scope. If thereâ€™s more than one variable or parameter with the same name, indicate 
which one is visible.

	(a) The f function
	(b) The g function
	(c) The block in which a and d are declared	
	(d) The main function
==========================================================================
SOLUTION:
@@@@ (a) The f function
===> The global variables b and c are visible inside the function, except that 
there is a local declaration of variable b which makes the global variable b inside 
the function anymore. Other than that, global variable c and the local variable d 
are visible inside the function.
@@@@ (b) The g function
===> The parameter a is visible to the whole function except to the block inside it.
===> The global variable b is visible to the whole function.
===> The global variable c is not visible to the function, since there is a local 
declaration. And the local declaration of c is visible to the whole function.
===> There is an inner block inside the function, where in variables a and d are 
declared which are visible only to that function. And the parameter a is no more 
visible inside the block since there is another declaration of a.
@@@@ (c) The block in which a and d is declared.
===> The global variables b and c are visible to the whole block, except that there 
is another declaration of c inside the function of which blocks the visibility of 
global variable c.
===> Any variable or function declared before the block inside the function f is 
visible to the block.
===> The parameter a is not visible to the block since there is another declaration 
of a inside the block.
===> the variable d declared inside the block is visible to that block only.
@@@@ (d) The main function
===> The global variables b and c are visible to the whole function except that 
there is another declaration of c locally, which blocks accessing global variable c.
===> the locally declared variable d is visible to that function.
===> The function f and g are visible to the main function.
@@@@ Any variable or function declared in any block of any function is visible only 
to that blok of that function but not to the other function.
