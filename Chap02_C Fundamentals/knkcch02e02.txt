============================================================================
--Exercise 2 (Section 2.2): knkcch02e02: Consider the following program:
	#include<stdio.h>
	
	int main(void)
	{
		printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
		printf("fill the time\n");
		printf("available for its completion.\n");
		return 0;
	}
(a) Identify the directives and statements in this program.
(b) What output does the program produce?
============================================================================
SOLUTION:
(a)
--Directives
#include<stdio.h>
--Statements
printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to ");
printf("fill the time\n");
printf("available for its completion.\n");
return 0;
(b)
OUTPUT: 
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as to fill the time
available for its completion.
