@@@@ Exercise 8 (Section 14.3): knkcch14e08:**************************************
Suppose we want a macro that expands into a string containing the current line number and
file name. In other words, we'd like to write

	const char *str = LINE_FILE;

and have it expand into

	const char *str = "Line 10 of file foo.c";

where foo.c is the file containing the program and 10 is the line on which the invocation
of LINE_FILE appears. Warning: This exercise is for experts only. Be sure to read the
Q&A section carefully before attempting!
==========================================================================
SOLUTION:
@@@@ Check PROGRAM OUTPUT.
@@@@ Step1:
	const char *str = LINE_FILE;
@@@@ Step2:
	const char *str = "Line "LINE_FILE1(__LINE__)" of file "__FILE__;
We cannot directly write "Line "__LINE__" of file "__FILE__ because __LINE__ 
is an integer while __FILE__ is a string. We have to stringize it.
@@@@ Step3:
	const char *str = "Line "LINE_FILE2(31)" of file "__FILE__;
Here LINE_FILE1(__LINE__) is expanded into LINE_FILE2(31), where 31 is an integer. 
As it is passed to LINE_FILE2(x) the 31 value which is in integer type will become a string.
@@@@ Step4:
	const char *str = "Line ""31"" of file "__FILE__;
